#1 Create two variables â€“ one with your name and one with your age
#2 Create a function which prints your data as one string
#3 Create a function which prints ANY data (two arguments) as one string
#4 Create a function which calculates and returns the number of decades you already lived (e.g. 23 = 2 decades)
